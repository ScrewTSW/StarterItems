  //	they first join a world.  Setting this to true will attempt to load StarterItems's logic AFTER other mods, and
  //	clear the inventory before.  There is a chance that other mods try to do the same, in which case, if you notice
  //	the player's inventory is not actually cleared before adding starterItems, please submit an issue to
  //	https://github.com/spoorn/StarterItems/issues, and I can add compatibility.
